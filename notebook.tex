\subsubsection{Date Created: 07/03/2019}\label{date-created-07032019}}

    In this report I will discuss the methodologies using during the
wrangling phase of the WeRateDogs project.

My wrangling efforts can be divided into 3 main subcategories:
Gathering, Assessing and Cleaning.

    \hypertarget{gathering}{%
\subsubsection{Gathering:}\label{gathering}}

    I gathered sources from 3 different locations.

The first source was programmatically downloaded from a url provided to
me by Udacity. By using the .requests package the file was downloaded
into the same directory as the jupyter notebook was launched.

The second source was downloaded manually from one of Udacity's
workspaces. This was a relatively simple process whereby simply clicking
on the started the download in my browser. The file was then moved to
the correct directory.

The last source was created by scraping information from WeRateDogs
twitter feed using the twitter api library, tweepy. Once I had created
my twitter account, the process for applying for a twitter developers
account was followed.

After authorising my developers accounts in the jupyter notebook using
my secret consumer key, consumer secret, access token, access secret, I
created an empty array and created a loop which ran through each tweet
id provided to me in the second source. The twitter API produced an
array in JSON format. This array when then dumped into a .txt file and
then read by the pandas library.

    \hypertarget{assess}{%
\subsubsection{Assess:}\label{assess}}

    Each of the three sources was then assessed using a variety of
manipulations including but not limited to, .head() .sample()
.describe() .info()

Each three sources was visually and programmatically assessed and each
issue that became apparent was then stored in a problems section that
would be addressed in the final cleaning section.

    \hypertarget{cleaning}{%
\subsubsection{Cleaning:}\label{cleaning}}

    The problems that were found whilst assessing the 3 dataframes were then
tackled using a variety of methods. The cleaning process was broken down
further into 3 subcategories. `Defining' -- which defined the problem
being solved. `Code' -- which showed the code being used to solve the
problem and `Test' -- which tested the code to make sure it worked.

Once the 3 tables were cleaned they were concatenated and this table was
then assessed and cleaned again.

    \hypertarget{storing}{%
\subsubsection{Storing:}\label{storing}}

    Once the final master dataframe was deemed clean and tidy enough for
analysis, it was saved as a csv in the same directory as the jupyter
notebook was launched.
